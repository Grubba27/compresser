# compresser
This project compresses txt files and has a description part too, the compress,
checks for the text, create a compressed copy of it and then you can use to decompresser.py
to recover the original one based on what you did to comprees the file

Start changing the original.txt file, there is the entry point of the compresser.
then go to the compressor.py and change it replace methods, try find pressibility in your original.txt because thats what you are going to repace with smaller txt. like in pt-Br that has a lot of "com" and "as", in english has some of it.

the decompresser cacthes the same words that you used and remakes the file as the original one.
